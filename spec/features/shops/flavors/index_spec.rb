# User Story 21, Display Records Over a Given Threshold (x2)
#
# As a visitor
# When I visit the Parent's children Index Page
# I see a form that allows me to input a number value
# When I input a number value and click the submit button that reads 'Only return records with more than `number` of `column_name`'
# Then I am brought back to the current index page with only the records that meet that threshold shown.
